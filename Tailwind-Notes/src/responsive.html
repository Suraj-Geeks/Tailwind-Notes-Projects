        <!-- md:flex is used to make the container flex on medium & above size screen. -->
        <div class="md:shrink-0">
            <!-- lg:shrink-0 is used to make the image responsive, this div wraps the image & prevent it from shrinking, which means it doesn't lose its original size even on small screens. -->

            <!-- h-48 & w-full is for small screen, md:h-full & md:w-48 is for medium & above size screen, object-cover is for an Image that cover space without lossing dimension & without stretching 
                 
              What Happens Without object-cover?
              The image might stretch or get squished if the container size changes. This is because the default behavior of an image is to maintain its aspect ratio, which can cause it to overflow or leave empty space in the container.

                Class	                Behavior
             object-cover:	Crops the image if needed but maintains aspect ratio. âœ…
             object-contain:	Fits the entire image inside without cropping, but may leave empty space.
             object-fill:	Stretches the image to fully cover the container, possibly distorting it.
             object-none:	Displays the image at its original size, potentially causing overflow.
